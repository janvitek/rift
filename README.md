# Installation

The following guide assumes Linux machine (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS). For Windows, enable the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" and then run the commands below.

> If you have opted for the virtual machine, you do not have to do the LLVM setup as the `pliss/llvm` directory has been created for you, and LLVM in release and debug versions has been already built so you can continue with the *rift* chapter. 

## Prerequisites

    sudo apt-get install cmake g++ git subversion
    mkdir pliss
    cd pliss
    mkdir llvm

## LLVM Setup

We now download LLVM and build at least *release* version of LLVM. The following commands download LLVM into the `src` and create a directory for the release build. Inside that directory, we run `cmake` to build LLVM in the release configuration:   

To speed up the build, you can use `make --jobs NUM` where num is number cores. 1.5GB RAM/thread is required, too many cores might run out of memory.

    cd llvm
    svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/tags/RELEASE_400/final/ src
    mkdir release
    cd release
    cmake -DLLVM_OPTIMIZED_TABLEGEN=1 -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=1 -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" ../src
    make
    cd ..

Optionally, you can build a *debug* version. This version takes longer time to link, but  produces better errors and helps debugging.

    mkdir debug
    cd debug
    cmake -DLLVM_OPTIMIZED_TABLEGEN=1 -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=1 -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" --enable-debug-symbols --with-oprofile ../src
    make
    cd ..
    
And finally, return back to the `pliss` directory to install rift;

    cd ..

## Rift

Now download rift:

    git clone https://github.com/PRL-PRG/pliss-rift.git
    cd rift
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

When make finishes, you are good for the lecture. As you will be fixing rift throghout the class, you will be able to run it using:

    ./rift
    
## Possible problems

The directory structure in the `pliss` folder should be the following:


    pliss
        llvm
            src
            release
            debug
        rift
 
 If the directory structure is different, LLVM would not be found by the build script.
